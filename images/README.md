Use py notebook (download_avatars) to scrape 2kratings site for their images
 -> Notebook takes in a list of names (roster_names) and creates urls (roster_image_urls) 
 -> Uses the creation to output a zip file (player_images.zip) with images and list of not found (no_images_list)
 -> TODO: Fill in missing player pics manually (this is due to weird URLS)
